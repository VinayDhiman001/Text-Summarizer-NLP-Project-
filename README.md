📄 Text Summarizer using NLP
🚀 Project Overview
The Text Summarizer is an NLP-based project that automatically generates concise summaries of long text documents.
It uses transformer-based abstractive summarization models to capture the semantic meaning of text rather than just extracting key sentences.

This tool is useful for summarizing research papers, news articles, blogs, or any lengthy documents.

⚡ Features

REST API built with Flask for easy integration

Dockerized for deployment and portability

CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions

Config-driven architecture for flexibility

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python

Hugging Face Transformers

PyTorch

Flask (API Deployment)

Docker (Containerization)

GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
